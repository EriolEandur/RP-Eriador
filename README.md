###Pull Requests (PRs)
<b>What needs doing?</b><br/>
There are three main areas of work to be carried out on the MCME Resourcepacks:
- <b>Items</b> - our Resourcepacks generally do not contain item textures, and instead inherit those from the Vanilla assets. Ideally, we are looking for completely custom packs, so any work in this area is greatly appreciated.
- <b>Replacements</b> - the original MCME Resourcepacks were based on various works from outside of the MCME network. As such, any textures that are not currently considered MCME 'originals' have a high priority for replacement.
- <b>New Textures</b> - The ethos for new block-textures is as follows; _we do not add textures for the sake of replacing Vanilla blocks. We keep blocks 'free' until there is a 'need' to texture them_.

<br/>
<b>Goal</b><br/>
The goal for the MCME Resourcepacks is to provide our builders with high-quality, original textures, allowing them to build awesome stuff! In order to meet this goal, contributions to the pack must be submitted and reviewed accorinding to the following guidelines.

#####Github Guidelines:
- Keep the number of commits to a minimum. This makes it easier for reviewers to see exactly what has been changed.
- Only submit relevant textures in a single Pull-Request. Create separate PRs for unrelated blocks/items. If unsure of what is considered relevant, create an '<a href='https://github.com/MCME/MCME-Eriador-Pack/issues'>Issue Tracker</a>' entry asking for advice.

#####Texture Guidelines:
- Decorative block (<b>not</b> including glass!), and item textures can be submitted feely.
- New building blocks must have been approved by an appropriate member of Staff. Proof of approval should be provided in the PR's notes (links, screenshots etc).
- To gain approval for block-textures it would be a good idea to start a <a href='http://mcmiddleearth.com/forum/resource-packs.28/'>discussion thread</a> specifically for the block you have in mind. Include the texture, any relevant screenshots, and as much information as to why it should/could be included. Keep in mind our 'ethos' for working on new textures.

_If uncertain on how your proposed change should be classified or submitted, start a new '<a href='https://github.com/MCME/MCME-Eriador-Pack/issues'>Issue Tracker</a>' entry asking for assitance/advice._
